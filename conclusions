\section{\Large Conclusions}
With this paper, we propose use of both visual features and textual features along with background common sense knowledge for image retrieval. We focus on both connotational and denotational features of the image, i.e., how the image is percieved by the viewer and what the image primarily contains. This gives us a balanced metadata(tags) to use in indexing which can be used to improve both retrieval and recommendation. Our pipelinr extracts visual and textual features, unifies them into a single representation and then enhances the entities derived to a more useful level with backround knowledge. By utilizing the combination of textual, visual and commonsense modalities we make the set of tags more appealing to the humans than traditional approaches. We support our claim by results of an internal survey conducted at the lab. Also, we prove relevance, significance and diversity of our set of tags objectively with multiple metrics and report an outstanding performance. The proposed concept could be easily extended for documents, videos or any multimedia.\cite{leong2010text} is a text-based baseline.
